# New Features: General Response and Document Creation

## Overview

The Autonomous AI Agent has been enhanced with two major new features:

1. **General Response Capability**: The agent can now respond to any query like a general-purpose LLM, providing helpful information on any topic.

2. **Document and Report Creation**: The agent can create well-structured documents and reports, including PDF reports that can be downloaded and printed.

## General Response Capability

### How It Works

The agent now includes a "general_response" environment that can handle any type of query. When a user asks a question or makes a request that doesn't fit into the browser, terminal, or file system environments, the agent will:

1. Process the query using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model
2. Generate a helpful, informative response
3. Display the response in the UI

### Example Queries

- "What is machine learning?"
- "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
- "Compare and contrast different renewable energy sources"
- "What are the ethical implications of artificial intelligence?"
- "How does blockchain technology work?"

## Document and Report Creation

### How It Works

The agent can now create documents and reports based on user requests. When a user asks for a document or report, the agent will:

1. Analyze the request to determine the topic and format (document, report, PDF)
2. Generate comprehensive, well-structured content on the requested topic
3. Format the content appropriately
4. Save the document as either a text file or HTML file (for PDF reports)
5. Provide download links and previews in the UI

### Document Types

#### Text Documents
- Simple text files with structured content
- Downloaded as .txt files

#### Reports
- More formal documents with sections like Introduction, Main Content, and Conclusion
- Can be downloaded as text files

#### PDF Reports
- HTML files formatted for printing as PDFs
- Include professional styling, headers, footers, and proper formatting
- Feature a "Print/Save as PDF" button for easy conversion
- Can be viewed in the browser and printed/saved using the browser's print function

### Example Requests

- "Create a document about artificial intelligence"
- "Generate a report on cybersecurity best practices"
- "Create a PDF report on renewable energy"
- "Make a document explaining blockchain technology"
- "Generate a PDF report about climate change"

## How to Use

### For General Queries

Simply type your question or request in the instruction field and click "Execute". The agent will provide a response directly in the UI.

### For Document Creation

1. Type a request like "Create a document about [topic]" or "Generate a PDF report on [topic]"
2. Click "Execute"
3. Wait for the agent to process your request
4. When complete, you'll see:
   - A preview of the document content
   - Download links for the document
   - For PDF reports, instructions on how to save as PDF

### For PDF Reports

1. After requesting a PDF report, click the "Open & Print PDF" button
2. The HTML file will open in a new browser tab
3. Use your browser's print function (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P)
4. Select "Save as PDF" as the destination
5. Save the file to your desired location

## Technical Implementation

- Added a new "general_response_execution" method to handle general queries
- Enhanced the "create_fallback_plan" method to better handle document and report requests
- Created a professional HTML template for PDF reports
- Added JavaScript and CSS for displaying document previews and download links
- Created a downloads directory to store generated documents
