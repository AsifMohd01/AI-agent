# Fixed Issues

## 1. Browser Action Error

### Problem
The application was failing with the error:
```
Unsupported browser action: Review the top search results from reputable sources like research papers, news articles from established publications (e.g., Nature, Science, MIT Technology Review), and blogs from leading AI researchers or organizations.
```

### Solution
1. Enhanced the `browser_execution` method to handle review/analyze actions
2. Added support for optional actions
3. Improved the prompt to guide the model to create better execution plans
4. Added fallback to convert complex actions into search queries

## 2. Step Information Display

### Problem
The UI didn't clearly show which step was being executed and what the expected outcome was.

### Solution
1. Added step badges to each result display
2. Included expected outcomes in the result displays
3. Enhanced the CSS to better style the step information

## 3. History Tracking

### Problem
The application didn't keep track of previous results, which made it difficult to reference them in later steps.

### Solution
1. Updated the `execute_step` method to store results in the history
2. Enhanced the browser execution to use previous search results when reviewing content

## 4. Prompt Improvement

### Problem
The model was generating execution plans with actions that the application couldn't handle.

### Solution
1. Updated the prompt to provide clearer guidelines for actions
2. Added specific examples of what NOT to do
3. Provided better alternatives for common problematic actions

## 5. Error Handling

### Problem
Errors weren't being properly handled and displayed to the user.

### Solution
1. Enhanced error handling throughout the application
2. Added more detailed error messages
3. Improved the UI to better display errors

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Start the application with `python run.py` or by double-clicking `run.bat`
2. Try the following instructions that previously failed:
   - "What are the current trends in AI?"
   - "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
   - "Find information about climate change and summarize the findings"

These instructions should now work correctly, with the application handling the review/analyze actions appropriately.
